FLOOD DISCLOSURE NOTICE
In accordance with Texas law, we are providing the following flood disclosure:
•Weareor arenot aware that the unit you are renting is located in a 100 -year floodplain. If
neither box is checked, you should assume the unit is in a 100- year floodplain. Even if the unit is not
in a 100- year floodplain, the unit may still be susceptible to flooding. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) maintains a flood map on its Internet website that is searchable by
address, at no cost, to determine if a unit is located in a flood hazard area. Most renter’s insurance
policies do not cover damages or loss incurred in a flood. You should seek insurance coverage that
would cover losses caused by a flood.
